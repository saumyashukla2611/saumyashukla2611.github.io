= Exploring Magick Package in R
:hp-tags: magick

Looking for image transformations and changes in R? Here is your package.

While reading about various packages in R, I came across this super fun package called as magick. It was published in December 2017 with version 1.6 and is a very comprehensive open source image processing library. The package supports various file formats and handlings. Well, the use of this package depends upon the user but I am planning to implement this in my Rshiny application.

To Install and load the package in R:

----
install.packages("magick", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/3.3/magick_1.6.zip")
library(magick)
----
I have a set a working directory, where I have saved all the images I am going to use for this demo. You can easily set it inside R studio: Session -> Set Working Directory. After this, there is no need of giving absolute path.

To load the image file
----
tj <- image_read('tj.jpg')
image_info(tj)
##   format width height colorspace matte filesize
## 1   JPEG   480    360       sRGB FALSE    26673
----


You can use image_display to see the image but its only available to preview the image in an X11 window.

There are many transformation options available with this package which makes your task easier of not using another tool to crop, modify, scale or even change coloring in the image. I have taken image examples from my favorite childhood cartoon series, Recess..lol.. lets see the transformation options.
----
p1 <- image_read("tj.jpg")
print(p1)
##   format width height colorspace matte filesize
## 1   JPEG   480    360       sRGB FALSE    26673

Well, I think TJ would look smarter with the border around the image.. what say?
----
image_border(image_background(tj, "orange"), "#FFA500", "10x10")

Use can include any color with the color code, also it provides flexibility to change border dimensions.

Well, how about some text in the image? I can generate my own memes in R you see..
----
image_annotate(tj, "WHY ME??", size = 40, color = "ORANGE", boxcolor = "BLACK",
degrees = 40, location = "+22+20")
----

You can change the degrees upto which you want to rotate the image of the text, the positioning of the text could be changed. +22 refers from the left end side position and +20 from the right hand side.

Well, hey Spinelli, why so blurrrr?
----
p2 <- image_read("spinelli.jpg")
image_blur(p2,10,5)
----
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saumyashukla2611/saumyashukla2611.github.io/master/images/4.PNG[]

Here, 10 represents radius and 5 represents sigma value.
----
p3 <- image_read("recess_gus.jpg")
image_charcoal(p3)
----

There many other options available, you can check it out from the link provided in the source section.

We can use animations as well, since all functions in magick supports working with layers.
----
p4 <- image_read("Mikey.gif") %>%
  image_scale("300x") %>%
  image_quantize(256)
print(p4)
##   format width height colorspace matte filesize
## 1    GIF   300    220       sRGB  TRUE        0
## 2    GIF   300    220       sRGB  TRUE        0
## 3    GIF   300    221       sRGB  TRUE        0
## 4    GIF   300    220       sRGB  TRUE        0
## 5    GIF   300    223       sRGB  TRUE        0

image_flip(p4)

%>% denotes piping in R

You can also morph the images:
----
p5 <- image_scale(image_read("vincent.jpg"), "x100")
p6 <- image_scale(image_read("gretchen.jpg"), "x100")
frame <- image_morph(c(p5, p6), frames = 10)
image_animate(frame)

fun..right??
----
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
library(grid)
data("AirPassengers")
plot(AirPassengers, ylab="Passengers(1000s)", type="o", pch =20)
grid.raster(tj,just = "bottom" , height = 0.4)
