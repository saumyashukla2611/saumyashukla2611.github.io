= Live Demo for CSS Box Model

Box Model provides us the layout of a web page. A rectangular box represents every HTML element here. Words such as padding, border, margin sound naïve and familiar but from a front-end developer’s perspective they hold much more importance. Through this article, I am shadowing upon the use of these words as a property in box model.

Below is the structure of the CSS Box Model, you can use the buttons in the live demo for each layer step-by -step to understand the model more clearly.
