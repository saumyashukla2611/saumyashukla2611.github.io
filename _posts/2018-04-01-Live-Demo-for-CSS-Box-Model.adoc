= Live Demo for CSS Box Model

Box Model provides us the layout of the web page. A rectangular box represents every HTML element here. Words such as padding, border, margin sounds naïve and familiar but from a front-end developer’s perspective they hold much more importance. Through this article, I am shadowing upon the use of every property in box model.

Below is the structure of the CSS Box Model, you can use the buttons in the live demo for each layer step-by -step to understand the model more clearly.
